war-cardgame - This program allows to play the war cardgame with multiple strategies and analyse this game.

# Installation

    pip install -r requirements.txt

# Description

You can play the war card game with the war.py file.

I detected multiple patterns appearing when playing, so I added a main.py to play a lot of games with different number of cards. The war_stats.py create files to try to analyse these patterns.

I added my manual analysis in the repo if it interests someone.

# Usage

To generate data to analyse :

    python main.py
